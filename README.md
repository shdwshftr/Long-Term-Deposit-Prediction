# About The Project 
## Long Term Deposit Prediction
This repository contains a project for Model Deployment Final Exam (4th Semester). The goal is to build a predictive machine learning model and deploy the model using FastAPI about customer long term deposit.

## Files
* The main file used in this repository is the 2602075491_BRANDONRITCHIEYANG_UAS_MODELDEPLOYMENT.ipynb Jupyter Notebook file where it contains the code for all of the process to build the model starting from 
data understanding, data pre-processing, feature engineering, modelling, and evaluation.
* The file used for deploying the model is the predictions.py Python file where it contains the code for deploying the model.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this repository is the data_1A.csv where the data is provided by the lecturer.

## Libraries
* The libraries required to run the Jupyter Notebook are pandas, numpy, matplotlib, statistics, sklearn, imblearn, and pickle.
* The libraries required to run the Python file are fastapi, pydantic, joblib, and pandas.
